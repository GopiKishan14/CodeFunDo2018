## Idea

Our idea revolves around safeguarding visitors from natural disasters.

**The product will have three working phases:**

**1) Pre-Disaster phase:**

* We will be using meterological data and location api (to share live location) to provide user specific hazard warnings. 
* We will be using chat bot to establish a connection between local people and vistors.

**2) In-Disaster phase:**

* Using chat history we will be predicting `people in need`, So, as to provide local support. (resource sharing)
* We will be using remote sensing to analyse the number of people in disater (on the basis of which, we will contact local police , army etc.)
* Since network availabilty is an issue, we will be using FM/AM radio network instead, which are built into most smart-phones and electronic devices, and can be used for 2-way communication even in long-ranges. Survivors can broadcast to a local tower and ping themselves, or/and be relocated to the nearest shelter.

**3) Post-disaster phase:**

* Monitoring of hospitals in that area.We will be taking into consideration distance from hospitals, facilities available, victims admitted and monetary expenses.
* Providing nearest Police station location.
* Updates on transportation faciity.
* Photos of victims to be taken at the relief centre. Besides determining who has already received the relief, the family of the victims will also be able to search their relatives by uploading their pictures (using azure face recognition api).
