## Idea

History has repeatedly shown that the losses of the visitors to a place has been more than that of the localites of the place at a time of natural calamity. Our idea is to safeguard the visitors when and where possible with the help of the localites and to provide the localites with greater and better insight on management of the disaster by informing them about the available transport, medication, food and other relief facilities.

**The product will have three working phases:**

**1) Pre-Disaster phase:**

* We will be using the location of the user(using location api for live location) and the meterological data to provide user-specific hazard warnings. 
* We will be creating a chat platform to establish a connection between local people and vistors.

**2) In-Disaster phase:**

* Using location history we will be predicting the `people in need`, so as to provide local support such as food, daily amenities. (resource sharing)
* We will be using remote sensing to analyse the number of people in disater (on the basis of which, we will contact local police , army etc.)

**3) Post-disaster phase:**

* Monitoring of hospitals in that area. We will be taking into consideration distance from hospitals, facilities available, victims admitted and monetary expenses.
* Providing nearest Police station location.
* Photos of victims to be taken at the relief centre. Besides determining who has already received the relief, the family of the victims will also be able to search their relatives by uploading their pictures (using azure face recognition api).

**Additional Features**(To be worked upon if and when the above features are completed)

* Since network availabilty is an issue, we will be using FM/AM radio network instead, which are built into most smart-phones and electronic devices, and can be used for 2-way communication even in long-ranges. Survivors can broadcast to a local tower and ping their location so that they can be relocated to the nearest shelter.
* Updates on transportation faciity.
