## Idea

Our idea revolves around safeguarding visitors from natural disasters.

**The product will have three working phases:**

**1) Pre-Disaster working phase:**

* We will be using meterological data and location api (to share live location) to provide user specific hazard warnings. 
* We will be using chat bot to establish a connection between local people and vistors.

**2) During-Disaster working phase:**

* Using chat history we will be predicting `people in need`, So, as to provide local support. (resource sharing)
* We will be using remote sensing to analyse the number of people in disater (on the basis of which, we will contact local police , army etc.)
* Since network availabilty is an issue, we will be using FM/AM radio network instead, which are built into all smart-phones and any electronic device, and can be used for 2-way communication even in long-ranges. Survivors can broadcast to a local tower and ping themselves, or/and be relocated to the nearest shelter.

**3) Post-disaster working phase:**

* Monitoring of hospitals in that area.We will be taking into consideration distance from hospitals, facilities available, victims admitted and monetary expenses.
* Providing nearest Police station location.
* Updates on transportation faciity.
* Facial recognition to hand out relief. Photos of victims to be taken at the centre. Facial recognition will determine if  relief has already been handed out to a particular individual at the centre.
* The families can search for their relatives by uploading their photos. `(because we will having a track of whom realief has been sent using facial recognition api).`
