## Idea

Our idea revolves around safeguarding visitors from natural disasters.

**The product will have three working phases:**

**1) Pre-Disaster working phase:**

* We will be using meterological data and location api (to share live location) to provide user specific hazard warnings. 
* We will be using chat bot to establish a connection between local people and vistors.

**2) During-Disaster working phase:**

* Using chat history we will be predicting `people in need`, So, as to provide local support. (resource sharing)
* We will be using remote sensing to predict number of people in disater (on this basis contact army police etc.)
* Since network availabilty is an issue, we suggest using FM/AM radio network instead, which are built into all smart-phones and any electronic device, and can be used for 2-way communication even in long-ranges. Survivors can broadcast to a local tower and ping themselves, or/and be relocated to the nearest shelter.

**3) Post-disaster working phase:**

* Monitoring of hospitals in that area. (hospital map distance wagera cost specialization patient status)
* Police station location wagera.
* Updates on transportation faciity.
* Facial recognition to hand out relief. Photos of victims to be taken at the centre. Facial recognition will determine if  relief has already been handed out to a particular individual at the centre.
* The families can search for their relatives by uploading their photos. `(because we will having a track of whom realief has been sent using facial recognition api).`

//PRE-BUILDING

//**SOMETHING LIKE THIS NEED TO BE WRITTEN**
/* We plan on getting our data as:

Meterological data from Indian Meterological Department
Social media text from Twitter,Facebook APIs and Google analytics for word-clouds
Satellite imagery from NASA lat-long public datasets, etc.
Once we have acquired the dataset, we plan on implementing the idea using image segmentation and feature learing, text mining and swarm clustering data models to use all the data-formats and correlate the trends so that we get more concrete conclusions and predictions.


The deliverables include

a predictive model (in the form of an app, or a website, or a portable service) that takes in the mentioned dataset information through the internet and outputs the mentioned suggestions during pre-disaster and post-disaster.
a predictive model that makes suggestions during-disaster using historical data, that does not depend on connectivity or real-time data. This will include suggesting optimal routes, thermal imaging, etc.
the app/service will also include a FM/AM-based pinging service to be used by stranded survivors during-disaster, and to communicate with the surveillance quadcopters.
Since the service provides predicitions mostly based on extensive historical data, using it in areas of 0 or low connectivity is feasible, without compromising on maximum impact. */
